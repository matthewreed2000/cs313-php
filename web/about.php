      <p>Hello! My name is Matthew Reed. I am a computer science major.
         I am the youngest of 10 children. I never know what I should say
         when introducing myself. I have always enjoyed learning new things.
         I learned to crochet when I was about 5. I learned how to program
         when I was 11. Most recently, I've started learning shorthand. I
         know all of the symbols, I just need to work on speed. I enjoy
         robotics, video games, and AI and hope to make one or more of them
         into my career.</p>
